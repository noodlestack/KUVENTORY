# QA Test Report

**Kuventory v2.0.0**

## Overview
This report details the testing coverage and status for the v2.0.0 Frontend Release of Kuventory. Testing focused primarily on workflow alignment, form validation, state management, and cross-browser stability.

## Features Tested

### 1. Inventory Management Workflow
- **[PASSED]** Beginning Stock initialization logic.
- **[PASSED]** Added Stock inputs update Total Stock successfully.
- **[PASSED]** Total Stock field is disabled/auto-calculated successfully.
- **[PASSED]** AM Sales and PM Sales inputs update Ending Stock successfully.
- **[PASSED]** Ending Stock field is disabled/auto-calculated successfully.
- **[PASSED]** Validation rules prevent negative stock calculations.

### 2. Form Validations (Zod + React Hook Form)
- **[PASSED]** Required fields block submission on Inventory, Sales, Expense, and Purchase forms.
- **[PASSED]** Numeric fields reject strings and negative numbers.
- **[PASSED]** Date validations correctly enforce correct formats and default to today's date.

### 3. Data Visualization & Reporting
- **[PASSED]** Recharts render correctly across all Dashboards (Sales, Expenses, Main).
- **[PASSED]** Chart tooltips are legible in both Light and Dark modes.
- **[PASSED]** Export to PDF generates well-formatted tables using `jspdf-autotable`.
- **[PASSED]** Export to Excel generates correct rows and columns via `xlsx`.

### 4. Code Optimization
- **[PASSED]** `React.memo` effectively blocks unnecessary re-renders in `DataTable` and custom table wrappers.
- **[PASSED]** Linting (`eslint`) passes with zero warnings or errors.
- **[PASSED]** Typechecking (`tsc`) passes with zero strict type violations.

## Known Issues
1. **Mock Data Latency**: Since the app uses mock `setTimeout` functions to simulate API calls, rapid clicking on "Save" before the modal fully closes can theoretically queue duplicate mock state updates. This will be resolved natively once actual API requests are introduced.
2. **Persistence**: Refreshing the browser resets all state to the mock defaults since data is kept in memory.

## Regression Testing
- Verified that removing the `Products`, `StockMovement`, and `StockAdjustment` modules did not break any routing or navigation logic.
- Verified that the application compiles correctly (`npm run build`) without missing imports.

## Cross-Browser Testing
- **Chrome (Desktop/Mobile)**: Passed.
- **Firefox**: Passed.
- **Safari (iOS/macOS)**: Passed.
- **Edge**: Passed.
