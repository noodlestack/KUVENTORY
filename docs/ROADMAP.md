## 🚀 Next Phase: Backend Integration

### Backend Developer 1: Authentication & Core Infrastructure
- Setup Django project and PostgreSQL database schema.
- Implement DRF token authentication (JWT).
- Establish base API routing and permission classes.

### Backend Developer 2: Inventory & Supply Chain
- Create Django models for Inventory Items, Categories, and Suppliers.
- Implement CRUD endpoints for Inventory and Purchases.
- Enforce business logic constraints (e.g., Total Stock = Beginning + Added) at the database/ORM level.

### Backend Developer 3: Sales & Finance
- Create models for Sales, Sale Items, Discounts, and Expenses.
- Implement endpoints to record transactions.
- Implement logic to deduct `Ending Stock` based on recorded Sales.

### Backend Developer 4: Reporting & Analytics
- Create aggregated endpoints (`/api/sales/summary`, `/api/reports/`).
- Optimize database queries for dashboard metrics to ensure fast load times.

### Backend Developer 5: Frontend API Integration
- Swap out `frontend/src/services/mock*.ts` with actual `axios` calls targeting the DRF endpoints.
- Map the backend JWT token logic to the frontend `AuthContext`.

## 🧪 Testing Phase

- Conduct End-to-End (E2E) testing on the integrated frontend-backend stack.
- Perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with Kape Uno Bistro staff.

## 🏁 Production Launch

- Setup Dockerized deployment with Nginx and Gunicorn.
- Final data migration and go-live.
